# Indeed-Web-Scraper
This project scrapes Indeed's website for Python related jobs in the New York area. The script will download the job posting page's HTML content using Python requests library and parse this information with Beautiful Soup to extract the desired information. 

To change search parameters, replace the job title and location in the URL object.
This script will only parse through the first page of an Indeed job search.
